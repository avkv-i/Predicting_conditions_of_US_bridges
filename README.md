<h1>Investigating and Predicting Conditions of US Bridges</h1>

The data used is from the US National Bridge Inspection maintained by the Federal Highways Agency (FHWA), part of the US Department of Transportation. The aim of the Bridge Inspection programme is to check on the state of bridges so that necessary repairs can be carried out. If this is not done, a bridge can fail. The dataset has information about the bridges and the condition given in the most recent inspection. The purpose of this notebook is to carry out an exploratory analysis of specific variables and use regression modelling to look at the effects of variables on bridges, to be shown to a specialist in metal corrosion and concrete deterioration. The predictor variables agreed upon are: age of bridge; average daily traffic of bridge (average use); the percent of traffic made up of trucks (trucks percent); material of bridge; design of bridge. These variables are used to determine how well they predict the current condition of the bridge and to determine which one has more of an influence.
